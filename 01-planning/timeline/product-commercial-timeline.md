## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Success Factors

### Technical Milestones
1. **Week 1 End**: Agent 1 analyzing products accurately
2. **Week 2 End**: Agent 2 generating quality visuals
3. **Week 3 End**: Agent 3 creating complete commercials
4. **Week 4 End**: Polished demo-ready system

### Risk Mitigation Adjustments

#### Compared to Story Movie Maker
- **Lower Risk**: Product analysis vs story interpretation
- **Faster Development**: Commercial templates vs creative storytelling
- **More Predictable**: Structured business content vs emotional narratives
- **Clearer Success Metrics**: Professional commercial quality vs artistic interpretation

#### Contingency Plans
- **Week 2 Delay**: Use stock images with product placement
- **Week 3 Delay**: Create slideshow-style commercials instead of video
- **Week 4 Rush**: Pre-record demo with multiple scenarios
- **API Issues**: Template-based generation with manual customization
