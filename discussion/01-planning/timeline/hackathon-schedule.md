- **API Access Issues**: Apply for increased quotas early
- **Technical Complexity**: Have backup simpler features ready

### Mid Development (Week 3-4)
- **Performance Issues**: Implement basic optimization from start
- **Integration Problems**: Test agent communication early

### Final Sprint (Week 5-6)
- **Quality Issues**: Have fallback demo content prepared
- **Submission Rush**: Complete draft submissions by Sep 20

## Daily Schedule Recommendation

### Weekdays (3-4 hours/day)
- **Morning (1-2 hours)**: Core development work
- **Evening (1-2 hours)**: Testing, documentation, planning

### Weekends (6-8 hours/day)
- **Saturday**: Major feature development
- **Sunday**: Integration, testing, planning next week

### Total Time Investment: ~140 hours over 6 weeks

## Backup Plan

### If Behind Schedule
1. **Week 3**: Simplify video generation, focus on image processing
2. **Week 4**: Reduce feature scope, ensure basic demo works
3. **Week 5**: Pre-record demo video, focus on stable submission

### Emergency Options
- Pre-generated demo content for reliable demonstration
- Simplified single-agent version
- Focus on one use case (e.g., vacation photos only)

This timeline balances ambition with practical constraints, ensuring a competitive submission while managing risk.
